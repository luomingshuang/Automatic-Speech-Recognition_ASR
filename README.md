# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
In this page, I have a collection of works (including papers and codes) about automatic speech recognition (ASR).
So I will try my best to record the papers and codes in these years. If you have any other news which can enrich and improve this page, I am very happy to receive your messages. Hope my work can help you!
